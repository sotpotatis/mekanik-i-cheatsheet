# Mekanik I Cheatsheet

Contains a cheatsheet with mathematical formulas and material overview for the course SG1133 at [KTH](https://kth.se). It should be (educated guess) similar to other courses covering the material in the book Mekanik I by Prof. Apazidis.
I am a student, not affiliated with anyone teaching the course. The material comes with full reservations for errors.

### Downloads

--> **Latest cheatsheet version:** [here](https://github.com/sotpotatis/mekanik-i-cheatsheet/blob/main/main.pdf)
--> **Latest flashcards version:** [here](https://github.com/sotpotatis/mekanik-i-cheatsheet/blob/main/maintex-deck.apkg)

### Auto-compilation

As I change the cheatsheet, it should automatically be recompiled and put here. You should find the cheatsheet with the very descriptive name `main.pdf`.

### Anki Flashcards

I created a utility that will probably move to its own repository (hence the existence of `latex-to-anki-README.md`) sometime soon. It should automatically covert the content to an Anki flashcards deck whenever I make updates.
The deck file has an even better descriptive name, I think it's something along the lines of `input-deck.apkg` or the other way around.

You need LaTeX for the cards to work in Anki and might have to mess around a little with the preamble. Feel free to open an issue if you need help.
